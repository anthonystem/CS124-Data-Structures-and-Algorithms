# CS124-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms course (CS 124) at the University of Vermont.

- **Project 1:** Find a data set containing 3,000+ entries, and use C++ to read the data from the file. In addition, write a custom function that performs a calculation on the data set chosen.
- **Project 2:** Apply stack and queue data structures to the data set to validate course teachings and discuss the different complexities of various stack and queue operations.
- **Project 3:** Analyze BST, AVL, and Splay Trees and how they organize data. In addition, perform tests to verify the different complexities of searching for a node in each type of tree.
- **Project 4:** Apply a set of different sorting algorithms to vectors of data. Analyze the number of reads and writes required by each sorting algorithm to make a sort, and use this information to validate teachings about the time and auxiliary complexity of each algorithm. In addition, discuss algorithm stability affects the way a set of data is sorted. Finally, look into the different applications of each sorting algorithm and compare the pros and cons of each.
- **Project 5:** Hash the data set and learn which hash function and collision resolution technique (open addressing/quadratic probing or separate-chaining) combination works best for the data set chosen. In addition, discuss how different hash functions and collision resolution techniques can affect data hashing.
